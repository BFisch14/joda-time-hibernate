<section name="Joda Time - Hibernate">
<p>
<a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda-Time</a> provides a complete quality alternative
to the JDK date and time classes.
At some point however, many projects need to persist these classes to a database.
One popular tool for achieving this is <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>.
</p>
<p>
To ease the integration of Joda-Time and Hibernate, this sub-project was setup.
It aims to provide the classes necessary to persist Joda-Time objects.
</p>
<p>
Version 1.3 was released on 2011-05-16 -
<a href="download.html">Download now</a>
</p>
<p>
Please note that version 1.3 is for Hibernate 3.6 and not Hibernate 4.0 (as the Hibernate team have
made another incompatible change).
The <a href="http://usertype.sourceforge.net/">usertype project</a> handles Hibernate 4.0.
It is also more up to date and more complete than this project in general.

The dependencies are Joda-Time 1.5 or later and Hibernate 3.6 (plus associated dependencies).
